# AoE2DesignerDataset
Version history for DesignerDataset - initially created for Dawn of the Dukes edition


Download link: [AoE2DesignerDataset on AoKH](https://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=13754)

Unlock all hidden units and display them in the scenario editor (Edited language file name for them to show up) without changing their attributes, or any modification to the actual vanilla units!

You can simply use this datamod for your maps in the editor (include units up to the latest version, Dawn of the Dukes) to your heart's content, and the map after editing will be 100% playable in vanilla.

How to install:

Extract both folders:
- Designer's Dataset - Unlock all hidden units in the editor (post version Dawn of the Dukes)
- Designer's Dataset (Strings)
to "C:\Users\Admin\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\(A bunch of numbers)\mods\local\..."
Make sure that the priority of the strings mod is higher than the main dataset mod! The priority should be like this:
- Priority 1: Designer's Dataset (Strings)
- Priority 2: Designer's Dataset - Unlock all hidden units in the editor (post version Dawn of the Dukes)
Uncheck all other Datasets / Strings mod you have enabled, or uncheck all of your mods except these two, just to be safe!


More instructions are included in the "readmeordie.txt file...

Some other note:


- Make sure to set your game language to English, otherwise hidden units won't be shown. I'll try to support this datamod for different languages in the future.
- Any duplicate units are reasonably explained (for example, hidden legacy objects like "Queen (hidden)"). For now, there are still some leftover duplicated units left (which are mostly just props), which will get updated over time to be classified.
- Place corpses/rubbles in your map with GAIA player, otherwise they would decay over time.
- Invisible units that I've changed their graphics data for my designing needs are: 94, 436, 438. Invisible when vanilla datamod is used.

- Thousands of hidden editor units, including projectiles, cliffs, rubbles, corpses, eye candies, legacy units, raider units, etc!
- Raider Units are units that can kidnap villagers
- MONKBT: A longboat that can convert other ships
- Bolt explosion: Explode when placed (no effect graphics) and destroy trees
- "Corruption" terrain: Battle Royale mode black border that creeps up in the map. Property seems to be similar to black tile, for now.
