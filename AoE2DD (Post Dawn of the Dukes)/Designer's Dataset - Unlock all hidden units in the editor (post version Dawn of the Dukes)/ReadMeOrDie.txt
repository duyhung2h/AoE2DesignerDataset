
This Designer's datamod supports the lastest version, Dawn of the Dukes! 

You can unlocks and work with hidden units inside the editor,
Add new eye candies like rubbles or corpses,
Freely placing cliffs off-grid,
 and works without modifying your vanilla maps.
 
The best friend for any vanilla map designer, who does not seek to implement their own datamod or keeping up to cope with the game latest version!

/////////////////////////////////////////    INSTALLATION GUIDE    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How to install:


 - Extract both folders:
  + Designer's Dataset - Unlock all hidden units in the editor (post version Dawn of the Dukes)
  + Designer's Dataset (Strings) 

   to "C:\Users\Admin\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\(A bunch of numbers)\mods\local\..."

- Make sure that the priority of the strings mod is higher than the main dataset mod! The priority should be like this:
  + Priority 1: Designer's Dataset (Strings) 
  + Priority 2: Designer's Dataset - Unlock all hidden units in the editor (post version Dawn of the Dukes)

Some other note:

+ Make sure to set your game language to English, otherwise hidden units won't be shown. I'll try to support this datamod for different languages in the future.
+ Any duplicate units are reasonably explained (for example, hidden legacy objects like "Queen (hidden)"). For now, there are still some leftover duplicated units left (which are mostly just props), which will get updated over time to be classified.
+ Invisible units that I've changed their graphics data for my designing needs are: 94, 436, 438. Invisible when vanilla datamod is used.
+ Thousands of hidden editor units, including projectiles, cliffs, rubbles, corpses, eye candies, legacy units, raider units, etc!
+ Raider Units are units that can kidnap villagers
+ MONKBT: A longboat that can convert other ships
+ Bolt explosion: Explode when placed (no effect graphics) and destroy trees
+ "Corruption" terrain: Battle Royale mode black border that creeps up in the map. Property seems to be similar to black tile, for now.
